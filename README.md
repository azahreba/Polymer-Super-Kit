# Polymer Super Kit

This is intended to serve as a simple (almost) ready-to-go example of how to
use [Polymer](https://polymer-project.org) 1.x with
[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org),
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), and 
[polybuild](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polybuild/).  There are a couple of
[issues](https://github.com/geppy/Polymer-Super-Kit/issues) that still need
to be worked out, but in general it's a good starting point.
