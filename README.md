# Polymer Super Kit

This is intended to serve as a simple (almost) ready-to-go example of how to
use [https://polymer-project.org](Polymer) 1.x with
[http://www.typescriptlang.org](TypeScript),
[http://sass-lang.com/](SASS), and 
[https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polybuild/](polybuild).  There are a couple of
[https://github.com/geppy/Polymer-Super-Kit/issues](issues) that still need
to be worked out, but in general it's a good starting point.
